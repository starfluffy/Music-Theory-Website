As a registered charity, they also make significant donations towards music education initiatives around the world.<br>

    <br>Their core activity is providing graded music exams, assessments and diplomas. An ABRSM grade has a worldwide currency and their exams are designed to motivate learners at all levels and ages, providing realistic goals and tangible rewards for their achievements.<br>
    <br>They support teachers and learners with a range of award-winning digital resources and publications, as well as host events and offer professional qualifications.<br>
